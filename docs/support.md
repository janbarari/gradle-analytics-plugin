# Support
Gradle Analytics Plugin is Open Source and completely free, I spent more than a year analyzing build bottlenecks and finding a way to track them, and finally implemented it into the plugin.

Of course, this project will be continued as a free open-source project. But to give me some energy, you can use either below ways to support me.
